# Realistic-Wave-Shader
Shader I wrote for my Graphics and Interaction Class for a Unity Game we were working on.

This method uses the Gerstner Waves ti animate water a water surface. Before this approach a sine wave was used to displace vertices on the y-axis of a plane, but this creates unrealistic waves. Below is a comparison of how sine waves and gerstner waves displace vertices on a plane.
